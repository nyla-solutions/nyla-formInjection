/**
 * 
 * <pre>
 * An operation represents an action to be performed of a question 
 * within a form. The operation concept is based on the command design pattern. 
 * Operations implements an execute method. It contains custom logic to satisfy 
 * the needed business processing.
 * 
 * Business operations deal with processing related to the retrieving data from 
 * the database and general logic that can only be performed on the server. 
 * 
 * For example, a business operation can populate a question on the current 
 * form with an answer a previous submitted form. Scripts should be used for 
 * client-side processing or offline form handling. Business rules provide a 
 * link between expressions and operations. Operations are executed when the 
 * form is retrieved for editing (in order to auto fill question answers see 
 * section 2.2 RESPONSE_TYPE.RESPONSE_OPERATION_ID) and when saving and 
 * submitting a form. Note that the complete list of operations will be 
 * maintained in a separate document (see GCSM Form Questionnaire spreadsheet). '
